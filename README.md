Motivation
----------

_sehrvy_ is an example project to explore server creation and database usage with Perl, and graph vizualization with JavaScript.

The nominal goal is to create a server that visualizes [Meaningful Use reimbursements for multiple healhcare providers][1]. Once we figure out how to do that, we'll have it serve pretty graphics upon request. The details still remain to be worked out.

The real goal is just to try stuff and learn stuff.

Requires
--------

 * `DBD::mysql`
 * `Net::Sever::HTTP`
 * `JSON` (either `JSON::XS` or `JSON::PP`)
 * `HTML::Template`


Try it out
----------

You can try running the server (defaults to port 8080), by executing the `run_server` script in `src/`.
